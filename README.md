## Description
Welcome to Habit Spot!

Habits can be hard to keep. So, I created HabitSpot as a solution to help users better track and journal about their progress with their chosen habits.

I was motivated to create HabitSpot because maintaining personal habits is important to me and I enjoy journaling to process my thoughts. For that reason, I combined these two things to form Habit Spot.
